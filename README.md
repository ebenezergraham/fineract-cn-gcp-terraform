# fineract-cn-gcp-terraform
Terraform scripts for Fineract CN GCP infrastructure.

This code case forked from openMF/fineract-cn-terraform

Region, project, environment variables should be set correctly in poc/main.tf, poc/terraform.tfvars, poc-tfstate/terraform.tfvars files. Description of variables is in vars.tf file.

A public key should be added to environments/poc/ folder, that will be copied to the bastion instance to allow login.

Manual deployment is needed through the bastion instance.

## Usage
Generate an RSA key-pair, and add the public key to `environments/poc/` folder. That will be copied automatically to the instances to allow login. The other instances will be accessible through the bastion - private pair should be copied manually to the bastion.

Set the desired region, project, environment values for variables in the following files:
* `environments/poc/main.tf`
* `environments/poc/terraform.tfvars`
* `environments/poc-tfstate/terraform.tfvars`

Run the following commands:
```
cd environments/poc-tfstate/
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
```
cd environments/poc/
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

For removing the infrastructure:
```
cd environments/poc/
terraform destroy
```
```
cd environments/poc-tfstate/
terraform destroy
```
It might throw error. In that case remove the Cloud Storage bucket and DynamoDB table manually.

Error cases:
If `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply` commands do not run, but the infrastructure is destroyed, it might be necessary to manually clean up the environments folder. For this:
```
cd environments/poc-tfstate/
rm terraform.tfstate
rm -r .terraform/
```
```
cd environments/poc/
rm terraform.tfstate
rm -r .terraform/
```
Then retry terraform commands.
